Mountebank is a great tool that allows us to mock services using different protocols. It is extremely stable and simple to use, yet very flexibile. When using in fast moving projects, though, boiler-plate code and organizing stubs can get unmanageable. Mbgen is an attempt to come up with a opinionated structure for organizing stubs and help teams move faster by generating this structure and most parts of the stubs.

### Installing
```
npm i --save-dev mbgen
```
You'll also need to install Mountebank.
